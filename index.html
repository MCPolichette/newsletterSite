			<h3>Who we are:</h3>
			<p>
				A grass roots organization made up of neurodiverse and
				neurotypical Clark County Nevada residence who want the
				brightest future for us all!
			</p>
			<p>
				Our organization was founded by Adonna Miller, a KIDS program
				teacher and public eductor with nearly 3 decades of experience
				and Drew White-Jacobson an advocate for the neurodiverse
				community, dyslexic adult, and mother of two autistic children.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have gained incredible momentum since the conception of this
				organization and strive to recruit and engage diverse members
				who can help us build a better world.
			</p>

		<div class="container p-3" style="margin-bottom: 80px">
			<h3>What we do:</h3>
			<h4>Initiative 1: Save the KIDS program</h4>
			<p>
				We are building awareness and advocating for Clark County to
				reinstate funding for 2 aids in the KIDS program (Autism Pre-K
				classroom) and return to a 10 student classroom cap.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clark County increased class size March 2023, to 11-12 students.
				Starting August 2023 the 3 person staff (one teacher two aids)
				will be reduced to one teacher and one aid. These changes result
				in a 20% increase in class size and a 33% reduction in skilled
				educational services and supervision during critical early
				intervention years for these autistic children. In addition to
				our concerns about the reduced quality in education these
				children will receive, this is a major safety concern. These
				classrooms require calm and capable staff to intervene when
				students become overwhelmed, distracted, or distraught. These
				children, as well as the educators who teach them deserve our
				support!
